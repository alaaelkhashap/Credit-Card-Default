## Abstract
Financial technology has mostly taken over our daily lives and simplified financial transactions and payments. Every day, a large number of people conduct transactions, but regrettably, some of them are unable to pay off their obligations. In order to lower the risk for the bank, we identify the clients in this paper who will go into default at an early stage and alert the bank about such clients.

## Introduction

Today, data has taken centre stage in banking, finance, and business. It kind of got hard to manage the data manually as the amount increased every second, so we turned to technology to automate activities and draw conclusions from the data for decision-making.
The worlds of money, stocks, credit, and investments are now a fast-paced and dynamic place for banking and finance. Many people use their credit cards to make regular purchases, and some of them are unaware that doing so will prevent them from making their monthly debt payments on schedule.

This might be problematic for both the client and the bank. It could cause a significant economic problem, similar to what occurred in the United States in 2008 when many people began to take out bank loans and then were unable to pay them back. This led to a period of economic contraction. As a result, the global economy was impacted by this crisis and lost more than $2 trillion.

Due to what we covered in the previous section and the significant risk that the banking and finance industries face, they have adopted cutting-edge technology, specifically the machine learning (ML) approach, to predict future decisions based on the client's historical data and determine whether or not a specific client can pay his or her debts. This will help to avoid a lot of issues in the future.
